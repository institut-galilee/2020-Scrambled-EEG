 /**
  \mainpage
  
  The BITalino Arduino API (available at http://github.com/BITalinoWorld/arduino-api)
  is a library which enables Arduino sketches to communicate with a BITalino device through a simple interface.
  The API is composed of a single file (bitalino.ino).
  A sample test sketch ([test.ino](http://github.com/BITalinoWorld/arduino-api/tree/master/test.ino)) is also provided.

  The BITalino device is connected to an Arduino through the UART TX and RX pins of both devices.
  The TX pin of one device connects to the RX pin of the other device.
  The BITalino Bluetooth module must be detached from the MCU module (as in BITalino Free Style configuration),
  since the Bluetooth module also uses the UART pins.
  The BITalino AGND pin must be connected to the Arduino GND pin.
  In a typical configuration, the BITalino device draws power from the Arduino,
  so the BITalino AVCC pin must be connected to the Arduino 5V pin.
  
  Since the Arduino UART is used to communicate with the BITalino device, it cannot be used to any other purpose at the same time.
  If you upload Arduino firmware using the Arduino bootloader,
  you must first disconnect the Arduino RX pin from the BITalino device.
  If you upload Arduino firmware using an external programmer, there is no need to disconnect any UART pin from the BITalino device.
  
  The API exposes a single object (\ref BITalinoClass "BITalino") representing a connection to a BITalino device.
  The connection is established in the \ref BITalinoClass::begin "begin()" method and released in the \ref BITalinoClass::end "end()" method,
  as in Arduino Serial library.
  
  The API was tested in an Arduino Diecimila.

  \section sampleapp About the sample sketch

  The sample sketch ([test.ino](http://github.com/BITalinoWorld/arduino-api/tree/master/test.ino))
  open a connection to a BITalino device.
  Then it starts acquiring all channels on the device at 1000 Hz and, inside loop() routine,
  it prints out one frame out of 100 and toggles the device green LED indefinitely.
  
  Since the Arduino UART is used to communicate with the BITalino device, this sketch uses a
  software-implemented serial port to output textual information from Arduino.
  The serial port TX is attached to Arduino pin 9, and the RX is not used.
  If you want to see the output text, you must connect Arduino pin 9 to the RX of an external serial port
  and set its baudrate to 115200 bps, no parity, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no flow control.
  The ground pins from Arduino and from external serial port must be connected.
  The serial port voltage levels must be compatible with Arduino (TTL 5V).
  
  \section compiling Uploading the sample sketch

  To upload the library and the sample sketch:
  - in the Arduino IDE, select the appropriate board model;
  - if uploading using Arduino bootloader, select the appropriate serial port
  (the Arduino RX pin must be disconnected from BITalino during upload as described before);
  - copy [bitalino.ino](http://github.com/BITalinoWorld/arduino-api/tree/master/bitalino.ino) and
  [test.ino](http://github.com/BITalinoWorld/arduino-api/tree/master/test.ino) to a new directory named `bitalino`;
  - open %bitalino.ino in Arduino IDE (test.ino is automatically opened in a new tab);
  - upload to Arduino;
  - if Arduino RX pin was disconnected from BITalino, reconnect it and reset Arduino.
